# Sentiment_Analysis
Sentiment Analysis

Overview
This project focuses on sentiment analysis using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to classify text data into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.

Features
- Preprocessing of text data
- Feature Extraction using TF-IDF
- Handling Class Imbalance
- Implementation of machine learning models for sentiment classification
- Hyperparameter Tuning for optimal model performance
- Evaluation metrics to measure model performance
- Visualization of results including Confusion Matrix and TF-IDF Features

Technologies Used
- Python
- Google Colab
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-analysis.git
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   
   cd sentiment-analysis
   
3. Install required dependencies:
   
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
Usage
1. Open Google Colab and upload the "Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb" notebook.
2. Run the cells sequentially to:
   - Load and preprocess the dataset
   - Extract features using TF-IDF
   - Train models with optimized hyperparameters
   - Evaluate and select the best model
   - Generate classification reports and visualization

Dataset
Provide details about the dataset used, including its source and structure.

Results
Summarize the results obtained from the sentiment analysis models and include visualization examples such as confusion matrix and important TF-IDF features.
